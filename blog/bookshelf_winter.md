title: Winter 2021 Bookshelf
---
Started the fall semester and stopped reading anything again - picking things back up over winter break, and hopefully continuing through the spring semester this time. Taking lots of suggestions from [Seita's Place](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/). Writing reviews and takeaways for books I particularly liked or didn't like.
#### Books Finished
* [Digital Minimalism - Cal Newport](/blog/bookshelf_winter_reviews/digital_minimalism_review)
* Steve Jobs - Walter Isaacson
* What I Talk About When I Talk About Running - Haruki Murakami
* Genius Makers - Cade Metz
* So Good They Can't Ignore You - Cal Newport
* A Ghost in the Throat - Doireann Ni Ghriofa

#### Books I Didn't Want to Finish
* The Making of a Manager - Julie Zhuo 
    * This book was fine, just a little dry, and as a current college student I'm probably not the target audience
* The Coddling of the American Mind - Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt
    * I agree with the reviews that this book could definitely have stayed as just an article. It's pretty one-sided and gets repetitive.

#### Books in Progress
* Good Economics for Hard Times - Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo
