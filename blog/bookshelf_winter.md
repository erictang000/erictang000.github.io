title: Winter 2021 Bookshelf
---
Started the fall semester and stopped reading anything again - picking things back up over winter break, and hopefully continuing through the spring semester this time. Taking lots of suggestions from [Seita's Place](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/). Writing reviews and takeaways for books I particularly liked or didn't like.
#### Books Finished
* [Digital Minimalism - Cal Newport](/blog/bookshelf_winter_reviews/digital_minimalism_review)

#### Books in Progress
* Steve Jobs - Walter Isaacson
* The Making of a Manager - Julie Zhuo
