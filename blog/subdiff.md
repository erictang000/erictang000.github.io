<!-- ## Methods for analyzing particle subdiffusion
In science, there have traditionally been 3 paradigms: Theory, Experiment, and Simulation. Now, with the rise of high performance computing for running more complex programs and harnessing more compute power, many are arguing that we may well have 5 paradigms - adding Data Analysis and Machine Learning as additional paradigms. Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and other physical sciences are seeing a boom in the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for generating understanding of previously loosely understood processes. 

The study of diffusion processes of particles in physics and chemistry are well studied from a large scale statistical perspective. We have equations to model traditional diffusive processes like Brownian motion, as well as for the subdiffusive phenomena of fractional brownian motion and the continuous time random walk.
