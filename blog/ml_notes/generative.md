title: Generative Modeling
---
Generative modeling (as opposed to discriminative modeling) is an area of machine learning which deals with modeling distributions over an input. For the common example of distinguishing fake images from real images, we can imagine a generative model would learn a distribution over input images, while a discriminitive model would learn a decision boundary instead. But how do we also synthesize images given an existing distribution of images? Or in other words, how do we train and sample from a generative model P(X) based on that image distribution X?
