title: Review - Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport
---
I think the majority of current college students are on their phones at least ~3 hours a day. For me it was getting up to maybe 4 or 5, and I started getting sucked into tons of hours on Youtube and Twitter in particular over the last couple of semesters (I was pretty good at staying off those sites prior to COVID hitting). I picked this book up on the way back from Chicago, and finished it within two days of picking it up. In it Cal Newport describes how he suggests going about a digital detox, and transitioning that detox into a permanent changes in how we view the role of social media, news aggregation sites, and technology in general as we go about our daily lives. I think subconsciously a lot of this stuff is pretty obvious - this summer in Chicago I pretty much was doing some version of this, deactivating instagram and trying to spend lots of time reading and reflecting instead of scrolling as much. But hearing all of it in one place and having concrete steps to move forward are what make this book more helpful than just seeing an article or video about someone trying to quit their phone.

With that said, here's my 'digital detox' plan for the next 30 days (starting yesterday, 12/28, so ending 1/28):
* No checking Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram
* No Reddit on phone, only certain subreddits allowed on laptop for more than the 10 minutes allowed by StayFocused
    * r/machinelearning is fine
* Netflix only as a social activity
* Youtube
    * Don't ever use on phone or laptop unless it's a video linked to me by someone else or a lecture recording
* Delete Discord and don't check it
    * Might need it for online OH for 61B so I might have to make a new account to join that
* Podcasts
    * Only listen while commuting, lifting, running (hopefully that will serve as motivation to workout more too)
* Music
    * Only listen in background while working on something that doesn't require deep focus
* Video Games
    * Only in social settings and for max 30 minutes a day
* Fantasy Basketball
    * Once the lineup is set, can only check scores once the day is over
