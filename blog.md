## Social Media Reccommender Systems
We all remember how toxic Facebook newsfeeds got around the 2016 election -- I remember an endless stream of videos from 'NowThis', and in general an overwhelming amount of political content and arguments. This was before Facebook rolled out it's 'Meaningful Interactions' update, and likely scaled back pure watch time as a metric for the ranking of posts. 

Anecdotally, I've found the newsfeed to be somewhat better than before - although I use it much less than I used to. Most of my feed is from groups that I joined at some point, or from people that I actually know, and if I were the type to still post on Facebook (a boomer), I'd be at the very least slightly more likely to do so now than before. I trust that the 'Meaningful Interactions' update did probably result in an uptick of user comments and messages between users. Maybe there's a heavier filter for political content now as well, since it seems like those also did encourage people to yell at each other in the comments - although I suppose that might fall under the categorization of interaction that isn't super meaningful. 

### Well being vs Pleasantness
What does it mean for something to be increase well being? What kind of videos would I believe to maximize my well being? Framing this within the context of social media reccommender systems is somewhat strange, although it does provide a compelling argument for it being something that's overall beneficial to society.

For example, I might feel better now if I watch a video that is more pleasant than one that is less pleasant. But does that affect the long term well being that I want to be able to maximize? Probably not. If Facebook and youtube maximized 'pleasantness', we would just get a bunch of cat and dog videos, which are nice, but don't contribute to well being in the long term -- in fact, it's possible I'd just spend more time on the platforms watching dog and cat videos, which could be bad for overall wellness long term.

If we want to do some kind of AI alignment for video valence understanding, I think a more compelling way to frame it is outside of the context of social media reccommender systems. The space is too fraught with questions like whether or not there are cultural of individual differences in what defines well being, or in whether spending time on the platforms is good at all.

I think a more compelling way of selling this is that we generally want AI systems to be able to understand how people will feel upon seeing some content, and that we can produce a dataset that will test the ability of models to do so while trying to eliminate spurious cues, by picking things that seem similar to a vision system but are easily picked up on by a human (we know a picture of JFK is nostalgic, but since it's not a cartoon, models have a harder time doing so). 

An example use case could be in robotic agents that have to interact in the real world sometime in the not-so distant future - if they see a scenario, they should try to have the ability to predcit how their human manager would feel about it without having some kind of hard coding done for what their human owner would feel -- they could then adjust their interactions accordingly without having to do facial recognition necessarily on the owner.

Well being includes both current well being, as well as long term well being - maximizing 


## Methods for analyzing particle subdiffusion
In science, there have traditionally been 3 paradigms: Theory, Experiment, and Simulation. Now, with the rise of high performance computing for running more complex programs and harnessing more compute power, many are arguing that we may well have 5 paradigms - adding Data Analysis and Machine Learning as additional paradigms. Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and other physical sciences are seeing a boom in the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for generating understanding of previously loosely understood processes. 

The study of diffusion processes of particles in physics and chemistry are well studied from a large scale statistical perspective. We have equations to model traditional diffusive processes like Brownian motion, as well as for the subdiffusive phenomena of fractional brownian motion and the continuous time random walk.

## On Motivation
How do people motivate themselves? Maybe there are the select few for which motivation is intrinsic -- I'm listening to 'The Making of the Atomic Bomb' right now, and many of the super smart physicists who worked on early atomic and nuclear physics would certainly count among those for whom it seemed like passion for a subject and enjoyment of the process was the primary motivating factor. But for most of us, motivation is something more fleeting -- maybe we worked really well for a few hours one time but can't get that feeling back, or we felt like there was a longer period where we had it but then we lost it. We read self help books, try imitating people who we think are more successful than us, or using productivity hacks we read online. 

The reality of motivation, at least in my own experience, is that it's largely been based on competition. The closer you are to the people who you are competing with, the easier it is to motivate yourself. Maybe this is unhealthy - but for me it's been true. I felt a lot more motivated to study for the Chem Olympiad in high school when I felt like I had something to prove to my friend who also started working on cracking the test. At my internship last summer, there wasn't really a sense that either me or the other intern were working very hard on the project - we were both doing other things, and had a sort of mutual understanding that we were mailing it in a little. I tried a lot harder in 61A than in my other classes -- probably because I wanted to prove that I could outwork and outperform everyone else in my CS classes, and no one else was really in my 53 and 7a classes, and so those didn't work. Life as a competition can be exhausting, and it would be great to just have the passion to do the things that I love and to spend all of my time doing those things. But in reality, if you don't feel uncomfortable where you are, or feel strongly that there's somewhere you want to be that you aren't, it's very hard to get yourself off your ass, and to go anywhere in an upward direction.

Telling yourself that imposter syndrome exists is good sometimes, especially if you feel like complete shit about something, but getting too comfortable not really doing anything can be debilitating for growth. You need to feel like there's something to lose if you don't perform, otherwise the stakes won't always feel high enough until it's too late.
